# Flexisaf Internship Program (Data Science & AI)

## Duration  
**September 2025 – December 2025**

## Role  
**Data Science and AI Intern**

## Organization  
**Flexisaf Edusoft Limited**  

During my internship at Flexisaf, I participated in a structured Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) training program designed to build a strong beginner foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and programming using Python.

---

## Objective  
The main goal of the internship was to gain hands-on experience and foundational knowledge in **Data Science and AI**, focusing on data preparation, visualization, and model development using standard tools and techniques.

## Activities & Learning Areas  

### 1. Python Programming  
- Understood basic and intermediate Python concepts  
- Worked with libraries such as **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation  

### 2. Data Science Workflow  
- Explored the end-to-end data science process, including:  
  - **Data Cleaning** – handling missing values, formatting data  
  - **Data Visualization** – using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to explore datasets  
  - **Machine Learning** – understanding and applying **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning** techniques  

### 3. Learning Platform  
- Utilized **Flexisaf’s Distinction Platform** to complete the **Beginner Data Science and AI Course**  
- Gained access to structured lessons, quizzes, and project-based learning modules
